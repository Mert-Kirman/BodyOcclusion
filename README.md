# Body Occlusion Behind Boxes ASCII Art

Python program that draws an ASCII scene that shows the person being occluded depending on boxes being in front of them.

## How It Works

The program takes three console inputs from the user which are: 

- Size of the person 
- Height of the box
- Width of the box

The python code then proceeds to compare the box dimensions with the person's size to calculate the degree

of the occlusion for each segment of the person (head, body, legs) and draws each segment sequentially.

### Prerequisites

An IDE or text editor to run the python code.

## Running the tests

At the start of the code; enter values for the size of the person, box height and box width in the console, all in separate newlines.
